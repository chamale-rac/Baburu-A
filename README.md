## About
Game Overview
Youâ€™re an astronaut who crashed on a strange planet. To get home, climb to the top using bubble platforms that gradually descend and burst after a short time. Reach the summit to find your way back to the station.

## Hints & How-To
- Keep moving: Each bubble pops quickly, so jump to the next one without delay.
- Timing is key: Bubbles descend at different speedsâ€”anticipate when to jump.
- Plan your path: Look ahead and plot your moves to avoid dead ends.

## Quick Playthrough
1. Start at the bottom, jumping onto slow-descending bubbles to get a feel for the timing.
2. As you ascend, bubbles might speed up or appear at tricky anglesâ€”stay alert.
3. Once you reach the top platform, youâ€™ll complete your escape and return to safety.
